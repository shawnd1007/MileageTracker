# MileageTracker
Mileage Tracker App is a Flask-based app that calculates mileage between multiple locations using Google Maps API. It generates PDF reports with trip details, directions, and reimbursement amounts. Deployed on Azure, itâ€™s also available as a native iOS app using WKWebView for mobile access.

The Mileage Tracker App is a web-based application built with Flask and deployed on Azure, designed to help users track and calculate mileage for business trips. The app allows users to input multiple locations, calculates the total mileage between them using the Google Maps API, and generates a downloadable PDF report of the trip, including turn-by-turn directions and a route map.

The app is also packaged as a native iOS app using WKWebView to display the web application, allowing for seamless use across mobile devices.

How It Works
Users enter their name, date, description of the trip, and an IRS mileage rate (default set to $0.67 per mile).
Users input two or more locations.
The app calculates the driving route between each location and displays the total distance.
A PDF is generated, containing:
Personal trip details.
Distance and reimbursement rate.
Map and driving directions for each leg of the trip.
The app is deployed on Azure and can also be accessed via a native iOS app.
